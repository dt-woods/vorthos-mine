"_I've seen the logo before..._"
<!--more-->

Building on the idea of _Vorthos Mine_ being an actual mine---an extraction of raw materials from the earth---I liked the idea of making logo into a mineral.
As with natural minerals, they can be made up of many elements: just like Magic: The Gathering is made of five key colors!

With this idea in mind, I went... to the internet!

To be honest, I lost a lot of time scrolling through free images on the web.
I've done it before and I'm likely to do it again.
However, this blog was meant to be a quick outlet that fills a niche in the Commander world of MTG.

That being said, I gave up on the endless scroll.
There must be a better way.

Back... to the internet!

The internet showed me that companies provide assets, such as company logos with custom color pallets.

I randomly chose [Looka](https://looka.com) thanks to it showing up as a recommended resource.
The site allowed me to quickly create an account, search images (e.g., "gem") and put it into a template, which ended up looking like this:

![](/img/looka_logo_2022.png 'Vorthos Mine Logo - https://looka.com/s/86830218')

See more of the asset [here](https://looka.com/s/86830218).

I was thrilled.
PayPal to the rescue and high-quality PNG files were at my disposal.

Next, I wanted to add color to my gem.
To make it MTG-related, I went... back to the internet!

A web search quickly identified the color pie.
The most common format was something similar to this (from [Fandom Wiki](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering)):

![](https://images.wikia.com/mtgsalvation_gamepedia/images/thumb/e/e1/Color_Wheel.jpg/350px-Color_Wheel.jpg 'Color Wheel - https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering')

I downloaded a version of this image and used the GNU Image Manipulation Program ([GiMP](https://www.gimp.org/)) to extract the HTML color codes.
Unfortunately, the colors were a bit dark, so lightened them manually and ended up with the following:

- W: fcc637
- U: 0078ac
- B: 3e3d39
- R: bc012a
- G: 50c878

The last challenge I ran into was the fact that despite having a high quality PNG image, the export included gradients of grayscale and non-closing regions within the gem.
It was back to GiMP to manually fix the coloring using both the eraser tool and the paintbrush to get edge-to-edge coloring.
I decided to leave the gaps (where the red and blue bleed across facets in the middle of the gem).
I think it gives it a little more personality.

To get the image to show up in Mainroad theme of blogdown, I cropped the image to just the gem, set the background of the PNG to transparent, and scaled the logo to 190x564 pixels.
The logo shows up next to the Mainroads theme title and sub-title, which brings the whole thing together.

Well, there you have it.
