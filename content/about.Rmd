**What is Commander?**

As described by [Wizards of the Coast](https://magic.wizards.com), Commander is a casual, multiplayer format, where you choose a legendary creature to serve as your general and build the rest of your deck around your general's color identity.
Your deck is allowed only one of each card with the exception of basic lands utilizing cards from throughout the games long history.
